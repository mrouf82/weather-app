Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Used different APIs from openWeather. Technologies used includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Task is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
